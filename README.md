This is a simple implementation of an add-on that shows tabs in the sidebar. It features:

* new tab creation
* closing tabs
* muting tabs (a bit buggy)
* drag and dropping
* sorting
* icons for the tabs
* spinners for the tabs

To do:

* fix muting
* filter by windows
* cope with window move events
* pinning
* possible context menus
